## Motivation
SUsing Zillow’s extensive range of data on home values throughout the United States, and many requirements for choosing locations, we will use time series analysis to assist in predicting the most prime investment areas for our new investment partners.



## Objective

The objective is to use time series SARIMAX model to predict which zip codes will be the best to invest in.



## Model Information

Following CRISP-DM Methodology:

We used a SARIMAX model based off our encoded engineered dataset to forecast future home values and ROI.
We used test data to validate our model.

Limitations of this model: 
Historical data of home values only.

## Our Process:

Does location have an impact?

We choose Chicago as our location of interest for future investments.

We filtered from 41 to 20 zip codes for possible investments – by using Zillow’s Size Rank score – it is based on population density of the zip code.  The lower the score = higher the population density. 
•	The idea/theory for this was:
•	Walkability score
•	Public transportation
•	Restaurants within x distance
•	Lower carbon emissions, etc…
